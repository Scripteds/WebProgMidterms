            <p>iACADEMY’s first campus was along Ayala Avenue in Makati. It first offered College courses on Software Engineering, Network Engineering, e-Management, and Digital Arts. The school grew its course offerings. In 2007, iACADEMY was the first to offer BS Animation in the Philippines. As the College program offerings grew, the student population grew with it. By 2014, iACADEMY transferred to another building along Buendia Avenue in Makati. The school started offering Senior High School in 2016 and the student population has grown exponentially that by 2017 the school had to build a bigger, newer, even better space for learning. Hence, the iACADEMY Nexus along Yakal St. still in Makati, closer to partner companies where industry practitioners and professors for iACADEMY come from opened in 2018.
            <br><br>
            iACADEMY’s unique approach to education has gained traction and has been awarded IBM Center of Excellence in the ASEAN Region, UNITY training and certification center, PwC Accountancy school partner, Toon Boom Center of Excellence, Most Innovative School, among others.
